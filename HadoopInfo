The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models 
It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines each offering local computation and storage
Hadoop enables the company to do just that with its data storage needs
It uses a storage system wherein the data is stored on a distributed file system
Since the tools used for the processing of data are located on same servers as the data
the processing operation is also carried out at a faster rate
